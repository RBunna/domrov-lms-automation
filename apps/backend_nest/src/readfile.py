I have a NestJS service that I want to unit test with Jest. The service may have:
- TypeORM repositories injected via @InjectRepository
- Other services injected via the constructor
- Methods that take input objects or parameters
- Methods that may throw exceptions like NotFoundException or BadRequestException
- Some internal utility or helper functions that should NOT be mocked; only mock repositories, external services, or dependencies

Generate a complete Jest unit test suite for this service following these rules:

**Test Case Writing Guidelines:**
1. **Structure:** Each test should include a unique Test Case ID, descriptive title.
2. **Inputs and Data:** Include all required test data explicitly. Cover valid, invalid, boundary, and edge cases.
3. **Coverage:** Test all functional paths (happy path, error conditions, edge cases). Ensure independent execution. Include traceability to requirements or user stories.
4. **Clarity & Maintainability:** Use simple, unambiguous language. Avoid combining multiple scenarios in one test. Document assumptions and dependencies. Keep test cases updated with requirements changes.
5. **Automation Ready:** Write steps suitable for manual or automated execution. Define preconditions, inputs, and expected results clearly. Avoid ambiguity.
6. **Assertions:** When using Jest `expect()` statements, **do not use TypeScript generics** like `expect(result).toEqual<Dto>(...)`. Always use plain objects: `expect(result).toEqual({{...}})`.
7. **Review & Quality:** Organize tests logically by module/feature. Ensure peer-reviewable clarity and completeness.
8. **Naming:** Test case IDs should indicate module, feature, and scenario type. Example: `AUTH_LOGIN_VALID_001`.

**Logic Verification Instructions:**
1. For each public method, generate tests that **assert the method returns correct outputs** for given inputs.
2. Include **edge case and boundary value checks** to validate internal calculations and branching logic.
3. Include **error handling tests** to ensure exceptions are thrown as expected (NotFoundException, BadRequestException, invalid inputs).
4. For methods with calculations, transformations, or conditional logic, explicitly check that **output matches expected logic**, not just that the method executes.
5. Ensure tests are **automated and reproducible**, so running `jest` actually verifies the method behavior.

**Jest Unit Test Requirements:**
1. Automatically mock all TypeORM repositories using `getRepositoryToken()`.
2. Automatically mock all injected services using `jest.fn()`.
3. Do not mock internal utility or helper functions; only mock repositories and external dependencies.
4. For all method parameters, create minimal mock objects so the method executes without errors.
5. Include tests for:
   - Successful execution of each public method
   - Exception and error cases (NotFoundException, BadRequestException, invalid inputs)
   - Verification of **logical correctness** of outputs
6. Do not connect to a real database or external service; all dependencies must be mocked.
7. Use NestJS testing best practices: `Test.createTestingModule()`, `beforeEach()`, Jest `describe/it` blocks.
8. Output a **ready-to-run TypeScript Jest test file** with each test having a unique Test Case ID.
