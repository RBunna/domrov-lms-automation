## Project Description

DOMROV is a learning management and automated evaluation platform built for programming courses. The project tackles the challenges of manual code assessment and overloaded teacher workloads by providing a unified system where students submit programming assignments and receive automated grading with AI-generated feedback, which teachers can approve. The platform also supports assessment management, class tools, analytics, and an admin panel.

In Cambodian computer science education, instructors face time-consuming manual reviews, subjective grading, and increased workloads, especially with remote learning. No local LMS currently offers automated evaluation or AI-supported feedback tailored to programming courses. Domrov fills this gap by enabling intelligent code checking, plagiarism detection, and structured feedback.

**Key objectives:**

- Build a web-based system for managing programming assessments  
- Provide automatic code evaluation  
- Offer teacher tools for class management, task management, resources, manual grading, and analytics  
- Deliver a student dashboard for submissions, feedback, and progress tracking  
- Provide an admin panel for user tracking and system monitoring  
- Integrate AI (LLM models) for feedback generation and code evaluation  
- Create a flexible platform for educational institutions or short courses

## Technology Stack & Infrastructure

DOMROV uses a modern, distributed cloud architecture to deliver scalable, secure, and efficient learning management and automated evaluation.

![Cloud Infrastructure](https://res.cloudinary.com/dgnugtetz/image/upload/v1772222281/API_Gateway_2_ndiw1r.png)

### Frontend

- Next.js (React) for the main client interface  
- Nginx as a reverse proxy and API gateway  
- AWS CloudFront and Route53 for global content delivery and DNS  

### Backend Services

- Node.js (NestJS) for the API Gateway and business logic  
- Python (FastAPI/Flask) for orchestration and AI task management  
- Amazon EC2 for scalable compute resources  
- Secure gRPC protocol for backend-to-backend communication  

### Task Processing & Automation

- Redis Cloud for distributed task queue management  
- RQ (Redis Queue) Workers for asynchronous job processing  

### Data Storage

- PostgreSQL (Neon) for relational data storage  
- Cloudflare R2 for file and submission storage  
- Cloudinary for image hosting  

### AI & Evaluation

- Integration with LLM providers (OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter, Ollama, and custom)  

### Third-Party Integrations

- OAuth for authentication (Google, etc.)  
- Bakong for payment

## Implementation

### 1. System Architecture & Internal Communication

#### gRPC-Based Distributed Architecture

The system follows a distributed architecture composed of:

- NestJS Backend – Handles business logic, APIs, authentication, and database operations  
- Python Evaluation Service – Runs a gRPC server and manages multiple worker processes  
- Redis Queue (RQ) – Handles asynchronous job scheduling  
- LLM Provider – Performs rubric-based evaluation  
- Database – Stores submissions, scores, and feedback  

#### Why gRPC Instead of REST (Internal Communication)

- Single entry point for all evaluation requests  
- Binary Protobuf messages (smaller and faster than JSON)  
- Strong schema enforcement to prevent contract mismatch  
- Built-in streaming support  
- Better concurrency handling for high-throughput evaluation  

---

### 2. Asynchronous Task Queue

- Redis Queue (RQ) for asynchronous job handling  
- Multiple Python workers for parallel evaluation  

**Workflow:**

![AI Evaluation](https://res.cloudinary.com/dgnugtetz/image/upload/v1772225042/mermaid-diagram-2026-02-28-034330_yq6xlr.png)

1. NestJS triggers evaluation via gRPC  
2. Python service enqueues the job into Redis  
3. Worker consumes the job asynchronously:  
   - Fetches submission files  
   - Estimates token size  
   - Sends request to LLM  
   - Normalizes output  
4. Result is sent back to NestJS via gRPC  
5. NestJS stores the final score and feedback in the database  

**Reliability Features:**

- Retry logic for transient failures  
- Token-limit detection before LLM call  
- Idempotent job handling  
- Failure classification (quota vs token overflow)  

---

### 3. Rubric-Driven LLM Evaluation

- Separate syntax checking from logical assessment  
- Use structured JSON output format  
- Convert rubric items into binary checks  
- Externalize score calculation  
- Normalize final score for consistency  

---

### 4. Token Optimization Strategy

**Techniques Used:**

- Code Normalization: remove whitespace, strip comments, minify formatting  
- Project Structure Awareness: send directory tree, reduce repeated tokens  
- Pre-Evaluation Token Estimation: prevent model overflow, trigger fallback  

**Result:** 30–40% token reduction, lower cost, faster evaluation  

---

### 5. Model Benchmarking & Selection

- Tested GPT-family, Gemini, Qwen Coder, Grok  
- Grok selected for lower randomness, stable scoring, strong logical evaluation  

---

### 6. File Handling & Storage

- Cloudflare R2 for secure uploads/downloads  
- No direct backend streaming  
- Reduced server load  
- Secure access control  

---

### 7. User-Provided AI API Keys

- Teachers can upload OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter, Ollama keys  
- Supports custom cURL requests for unsupported providers  

---

### 8. Payment Implementation

#### Overview

- KHQR payments via Bakong  
- Backend polls for payment status asynchronously  
- WebSocket pushes status updates to frontend  
- Redis controls single active payment session per user (3-minute TTL)
